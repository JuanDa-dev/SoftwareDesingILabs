Create Your Own Modules
Node.js allows you to create and use your own modules. You can define a module by creating a JavaScript file and exporting its functions, objects, or variables using the module.exports object. You can then import your module into another file using the require() function.

Node.js as a Web Server
Node.js can be used as a web server to serve dynamic web pages and respond to HTTP requests. You can use the built-in http module or a third-party package like express to create a web server in Node.js.

Node.js File System Module
Node.js has a built-in fs module that allows you to work with the file system on your computer. You can use this module to read and write files, create directories, delete files, and much more.

Node.js URL Module
Node.js has a built-in url module that allows you to parse and manipulate URLs. You can use this module to extract information from a URL, such as the hostname, pathname, query parameters, and more.

Node.js Events
Node.js has a built-in events module that allows you to create and handle custom events in your application. You can use this module to create event emitters and event listeners, which can help you build scalable and reactive applications.

Node.js Upload Files
Node.js can be used to implement file uploads on web applications. To handle file uploads, you can use a package called multer, which is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.

Node.js Send an Email
Node.js can also be used to send emails from your application. To send emails, you can use a package called nodemailer. With nodemailer, you can specify the email service provider and the authentication credentials, define mail options such as the sender, recipient, subject, and content of the email, and send the email.
